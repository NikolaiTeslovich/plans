This makes all your basic RC plane parts compatible with lego technic for the creation of endless projects such as this RC car. **Note that these parts are not strictly for an RC car**

The motor mount fits a standard 16mm by 19mm motor. I based it around the Flite Test "Radial" 2212B 1050kV Brushless Motor.

The servo mount should fit just about any 9g servo. I used some cheap 9g analog servo off of Amazon. 

The FPV camera mount was based off of an AIO (all in one) FPV camera. Most Micro size cameras should be compatible with this mount.
